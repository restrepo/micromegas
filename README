The file content of the code is described in the file fileMap.txt

   We use 'gmake' options in our Makefiles. If you do not have 'gmake'
   then in general  'make' can be used  instead of  'gmake'.

I. General  installation.
   Launch
       [g]make

   It should generate files with compilers flags
       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForMake
       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh

   and  compile
       CalcHEP_src/bin/s_calchep
       lib/micromegas.a

   Possible problems are discussed in Section VII below.

micromegas_6.0 was tested for  Linux, and  Darwin 

II. To work with MSSM, NMSSM, CPVMSSM, IDM, LHM,   Z3IDM, Z4IDSM  models
    go to the corresponding directory.

    To generate an executable use
     [g]make main=<source file>

    <source file> is expected to be a C  (.c) file  or  C++ (.cpp) one.

    The list of functions you can use in your programs is described in man/manual_6.0.pdf as well as
    hep-ph/0405253, hep-ph/0607059, arXiv:0803.2360[hep-ph], arXiv:1005.4133[hep-ph], arXiv:1305.0237[hep-ph],
    arXiv:1407.6129[hep-ph], arXiv:1606.03834[hep-ph], arXiv:1801.03509[hep-ph], arXiv:2312.14894[hep-ph].


III. Each model directory  contains at least one sample  file:
      main.c
     a sample for C++  can be obtained by 'cp main.c main.cpp'

     main.c  contain  several independent modules
     which can be switched ON  by '#define' preprocessor instructions
     at the top of the file.

     The modules are:

   a) MASSES_INFO
       displays mass spectrum for odd particles (super partners) and
       Higgs particles as well as Higgs widths;
   b) CONSTRAINTS
       checks experimental  constraints;
   c) HIGGSBOUNDS
	calls HiggsBounds to constrain the Higgs sector;
   d) HIGGSSIGNALS
        Calls HiggsSignals to constrain the SM Higgs;
   d) LILITH
	calls LiLith to constrain the Higgs sector;
   e) SModelS
	calls SModelS to constrain the new physics sector;
   f) OMEGA
       computes the relic density for freeze-out;
   g) FREEZEIN
       computes the relic density for freeze-in;
   h) INDIRECT_DETECTION
       calculates the WIMP annihilation spectra and integrates
       over the halo profile;
   i) LOOP_GAMMA
       calculates the two-photon spectrum from annihilation of two neutrinos
       into two-photons and     Z-photon;
   j) RESET_FORMFACTORS
       resets parameters of nucleon form factors, DM velocity
       distribution, and nucleus Fermi density;
   k) CDM_NUCLEON
       calculates WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering amplitudes  and cross-sections;
   l) CDM_NUCLEUS
       calculates the number of events for 1day&1kg  of detector material and
       recoil energy distribution for WIMP-nuclei interactions;
   m) NEUTRINO
	computes the neutrino flux from DM captured in the Sun/Earth and
	the corresponding muon flux;
   n) DECAYS
	computes the decay widths and branching ratios for any particle;
   o) CROSS_SECTIONS
       calculates cross sections for any 2->2 process and some 2->3 processes
   p) CLEAN
	cleans intermediate files

   The switch 
      #define  SHOWPLOTS
   allows to display plots on the screen


IV.   Each model contains a  directory  work/   which is intended for the calculation of matrix elements with CalcHEP. The
      compiled codes of matrix elements are stored in the directory work/so_generated.  
      The directory work/ also contains the executable file ./calchep, which launches an interactive CalcHEP session that allows
      to calculate different cross sections and decay widths in the model under consideration.

V.  To implement a new model, launch
    ./newProject  <project name>

     Then the directory <project name> will be created with all needed subdirectories
     and  sample  files inside. Next you need to put the new model files in the
     work/models directory. Further instructions can be found in the local
     README file.


VI. To clean all generated files use
   [g]make clean
   launched from micromegas_X directory. In each model directory you
   can call
     [g]make clean
   to remove all generated files in this particular directory.

VII. Compilers and  their Flags
    Options for compilation are stored in the file
       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh
    If this files does not exist, it is generated by [g]make according
    to Unix version. If CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh exists, [g]make
    only checks it.  In case of problem with compilers and their flags
    one can improve CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh and launch [g]make again.
    Using
         [g]make clean
    you will be asked about an option to save FlagsForSh for the next
    compilation.
        [g]make flags
    only generates FlagsForSh file. It gives you an option to
    select the compiler and flags you prefer.

Special requirements  
     1) For graphical interface, in particular for interactive CalcHEP session and
        plot facilities the X11-devel package is required, it depends on the platform:  

 	      libX11-devel    for Fedora/Scientific, old Darwin(Mac)
              Xquartz ( https://www.xquartz.org)     new Mac
              libX11-dev      for Ubuntu/Debian      [old Ubuntu]
              libx11-dev      for Ubuntu/Debian      [new Ubuntu]
              xorg-x11-devel  for SUSE

      If you have *.h files in the directory   /usr/include/X11, then X11-devel is installed.
      micrOMEGAs works without X11-devel, however graphical options will not be available.  
            
      2) Fortran is needed for some models that use external libraries written in Fortran, for example MSSM or NMSSM.
      But in general having a Fortran compiler is not a strict requirement.
