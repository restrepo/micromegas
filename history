9. Version 6.0 19.12.2023

   a) The calculation of the relic density  and of the  direct and indirect detection rate of DM are performed in the 
      framework of multi-component DM models.
   b) To take into account the  possibility of lack of chemical equilibrium within some dark sector where particles 
      have identical charges with respect to an internal symmetry, we provide an option to split the sector into two 
      or more subsectors. The equations for DM formation  is then solved assuming thermal equilibrium within 
      subsectors only.  The processes of co-scattering and decay between subsectors/sectors  are taken into account.
   c) The multi-component set of equations  can also treat  DM models which contain simultaneously  WIMP and feeble 
      particles. In this case quantum statistics effects are not included. 
   d) For freeze-in calculation we  have included an option to take into account screening  effects caused by thermal 
      masses of particles in the bath,  for this a cut on t/u-channel propagators is imposed.
   e) We have improved the formulas for running QCD couplings and masses to include 4-loop effects.
   f) We have implemented new spectra for stable particle production from DM annihilation relevant for indirect 
      detection, in particular : arXiv: 2202.11546,  arXiv:1009.0224. New  photon spectra from production 
      of pions and kaons in light DM scenarios are implemented as well.
   g) A routine for  calculating the  effect of Sommerfeld enhancement in cases of a single scalar and/or vector 
      exchange is provided.
   h) We have realized a possibility to take into account resonance contribution of 2->4 processes  for calculation of 
      relic  density and indirect detection signal. 
   i) We implement an option to add to decays of a given particle the reactions with n_min+1 outgoing particles, 
     where n_min is a minimal number of outgoing particles.
   j) Z7 model is included :  2212.07488 [hep-ph]

8. Version 5.3.36  05.08.2022 
   a) A bug in freeze-in calculation is fixed.

7. Version 5.3.35 08.07.2022
  
 a) only cleaning of version (removing test code, test data, improving text files etc...), no change in any function.

6. Version 5.3.33  03.06.2022
   a) In 1-> 3 decays involving u,d quarks, we impose a cut on the invariant mass of u,d of 1 GeV. This is to avoid double counting processes with pions final states, see line 410 in CalcHEP_src/c_source/dynamicME/kin4.c 
  
 b)  We had a bug in the function which determines the deviation of abundances from their equilibriom value at high temperature. This is  used for finding the starting point for solving abundance equations in darkOmegaN.


   c)  If the compilation of the main code shows a problem with the fortran compiler, micrOMEGAs runs without using fortran and issues warnings. 

 
5. Version 5.3.31  01.05.2022
   a) We had a difference about 3% between darkOmega and darkOmegaN because some processes were not included in the darkOmegaN. It is fixed now. A similar bug is fixed in vSigma.

   b) We have rewritten vSigmaNCh, see manual.
 
    c) There is a new routine  
       checkTE( n, T, mode, Beps) which checks condition of chemical equilibrium in the n^th thermal sector, see manual.
   
 d) The function defTEset is renamed  defThermalSet
    
 

4. Version 5.3.30  17.04.2022
   a) micrOMEGAs had a bug in the functions used for matrix diagonalization for a matrix of fixed dimension.       These functions were not rewritten properly when the numerical type for internal micrOMEGAs calculations was changed by the user  from "double" to "REAL". The updated files are CalcHEP_src/c_source/SLHAplus/fixArg.c and CalcHEP_src/c_source/SLHAplus/include/SLHAplus.h. The diagonalization procedures that get the size of the matrix through the first argument of
      the function are not modified.     

   b) A bug in DD_pval(Experiments, fv, expName) called with expName!=NULL is fixed.
   
 c) 1->3 and 1->4 decays are included in freeze-in calculations.
 
3. Version 5.3.29  11.04.2022
   a) X11 fonts for CalcHEP screen: ^+ and ^- command allow to change font width as in 
      previous versions. New hot keys ^< and ^> allow to change fonts keeping font width 
      fixed. The improved file is CalcHEP_src/c_source/chep_crt/xwin/X11_crt0.c
   b) micrOMEGAs did not show correctly the contribution of decay processes to relic density in freeze-in
      scenarios. We thank Carlos Yaguna for reporting this problem.
 
  c) In MSSM we had a bug which did not allow compilation without a fortran compiler even if it was not needed,  for instance, using a SLHA input or softSusy. MSSM/lib/Makefile was improved
      for this purpose.
  
 d) Instead of pWidthPlus presented in the previous version we have implemented a new routine
      pWidthPref(particle_name, pref) which forces  pWidth to work like  pWidthPlus.
         pref=2*keySLHA+keyN
         keySLHA=0  => do not use SLHA data for width
         keySLHA=1  => use SLHA data if they exist
      micrOMEGAs is sensitive to keyN if SLHA data are not used   
         KeyN=0     => calculate width using processes with minimal number of decay products
         keyN=1     => use minimal + next to minimal number of decay products while excluding
                       processes with open  s-channel resonances.
      This scheme leads to pref=0,..3. If pref is chosen in this range, the calculation of
      width does not depend on the useSLHAwidth flag. Default option is pref=4. In this case
      the useSLHAwidth flag is taken into account and the minimal number of decay products
      is used.  All changes are in files
          CalcHEP_src/c_source/dynamicME/kin4.c  
          CalcHEP_src/c_source/dynamicME/include/dynamic_cs.h
    e) New interface with SModelsS-2.2.0.post1

2. Version 5.3.28  30.3.2022 
   a) PandaX DD SI  exclusion: PandaX4T(MDM)

   b) A bug in pWidth (CalcHEP_src/c_source/dynamicME/kin4.c) is fixed.
      pWidth looks for a minimal nout such that width(P->nout*x) > 0.  Previously the
      existence of an on-shell reaction P->nout*x was treated as a non-zero width, even when the
      width was zero because the relevant coupling was zero.

     c) In the calculation of 2->3 processes with virtual W/Z, diagrams that lead to t-channel pole on-shell are excluded. A more accurate procedure that involve cutting the pole is under development.

   d) New function for testing :  double pWidthPlus(char *name, txtList *L, int rewrite). 
(This has since  been replaced by pWidthPref)
      Like pWidth() it finds a minimal nout which gives a  non- zero width for 
      "name->nout*x" processes  but also adds channels "name->(nout+1)*x"  for reactions 
      which do not contain on-shell virtual particles.
      
      This function ignores  preliminary  calculated widths and widths from SLHA file.
      If parameter rewrite==0, then decay table is not filled. Otherwise  
      information about particle decay in decay table is rewritten and next call of  pWidth 
      will return width and branching calculated by pWidthPlus.
      If VWdecay/VZdecay!=0 and minimal nout==2, when calculating 3body final states pWidthPlus 
      ignores processes with virtual  W/Z.  
    
1. Version 5.3.27   22.3.2022

    a) 2->2 processes with incoming photon or gluon, such as  A, X-> Y,Z can be treated as 
       "decays in thermal bath", namely such processes are excluded if M(X) > M(Y)+M(Z). 
       Indeed it is known that for such processes the infrared divergence in radiation is cancelled 
       by loop diagram, see 1110.2171, 1607.03910. Moreover when  M(X) is slightly below  M(Y)+M(Z), 
       a cut is implemented such that the thermal mass of A/G is used to set the threshold for this                        reaction.  
      
   b) Processes with virtual W/Z and A/G  are excluded, for example, A,~1+ -> ~o1,E,ne 
    as described above. Moreover this avoids the problem of  collinear divergence caused by photon radiation from the electron leg. 
    
    c) A bug was fixed  in  the Monte Carlo  calculation  of 2->3 processes that were used for SModels input.
    
    d) HiggsBounds/HiggsSignals update
          HiggsBounds   5.5.0 => 5.10.0 
          HiggsSignals  2.3.0 => 2.6.2 
    e) We had a bug in the interface with HiggsSignals. In the output of HS, several experimental limits are given andfor some reason, sometimes the first one is repeated twice. Previously we ignored the first
       record of HS output to exclude doubling. It appears that sometimes the first result is not
       repeated and therefore information was lost.
